# DMG-01-Shell
A replica Game Boy shell made in Autodesk Fusion 360

## Progress
The front shell is mostly complete, and is completely compatible with the original Game Boy parts. However some screw holes may be slightly offset from the original.\
The back shell is incomplete, and is not yet compatible with the Game Boy hardware.

## Print settings
I recommend printing on a resin printer if possible, since the tolerances will be more accurate.\
The print should not be done with the part facing directly down, instead I recommend printing it upside-down and tilted about 15 degrees on the X and Y axis *(Z-up)*.\
Use durable resin if possible. Since the shell is the same thickness as the original shell, it might snap if over-cured or printed with brittle resin.\
This is untested on a traditional FDM printer since I havent had time to prep my FDM printer for such a big print.

## Where are the CAD files?
The CAD files will be on [my Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/guiguig) for the time being, but they will be released for free when the project is mostly completed.

## Fonts
The fonts used for the port labels (PHONES, EXT. CONNECTER, etc.) is **Futura PT Book**, while the "Game Boy" logo text is in **Gill Sans Nova Book**.
